TODO Items for Tutorials


Can question_text provide the user with more empty lines to fill?

How do we automate the checking of package version? Should we?

How can we automate the testing of hints? Or maybe make all hints eval=FALSE?

How test for exercise chunks with no lines, which causes a weird error?

Can't we do better than the absurd   incorrect = "Ok" hack in all the text questions?

Never instructor a student to replace an object with a different one with the same name. This only causes trouble, mainly since a student might end up running this line of code twice, and it won't work the second time!

We need the full answer as the last question, at least. That is: Make this plot.

Make them build step by step, one line after the other. Setting up interim results is confusing. Set up chunks are a bad idea. Get rid of all of them!

Fix the two exercises which I had to comment out.

Best way to allow students to ctach up is, every few questions, have a "hint" which shows all the code up yill now, and then also a part of the current step. Don't forget eval=FALSE if there are ... in the hint.

I like the way Jake did this:
