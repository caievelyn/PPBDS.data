```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(learnr)
library(shiny)
library(gt)
library(PPBDS.data)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE)
options(tutorial.exercise.timelimit = 60, tutorial.storage="local")
```

## Confirm Correct Package Version
###

Confirm that you have the correct version of PPBDS.data installed by pressing "Run Code."

```{r confirm, exercise=TRUE}
packageVersion('PPBDS.data')
```

The answer should be ‘0.3.2.9005’, or a higher number. If it is not, you should upgrade your installation by issuing these commands:


```{r confirm-advice, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
remove.packages('PPBDS.data')  
library(remotes)  
remotes::install_github('davidkane9/PPBDS.data')  
```

Strictly speaking, it should not be necessary to remove a package. Just installing it again should overwrite the current version. But weird things sometimes happen, so removing first is the safest approach. 

## Name 
###

``` {r name, echo=FALSE}
question_text(
  "Student Name:",
  answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "Ok"
)
```

## Preceptor Tables

```{r question-preceptor-tables}
quiz(
question_text(
    "Give a one sentence definition of a Preceptor Table.",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

## Causal effect
###

Retrys are not allowed on multiple choice questions, so read and answer carefully!

### Exercise 1

```{r ce-1}
quiz(
question("What is the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference?",
    answer("It is impossible to observe multiple potential outcomes at once.", correct = TRUE, message = "Nice!"),
    answer("We don't know the potential outcomes for people not surveyed.", message = "Go read the section on Causal Effects"), 
    allow_retry = FALSE
  ))
```

### Exercise 2

```{r ce-2}
quiz(question_text("Explain a 'counterfactual' in a brief phrase. 'Potential outcome' might be helpful to use in your answer.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Ok")
)
```

### Exercise 3

```{r ce-3}
quiz(
  question_text("In one sentence, explain what a causal effect is according to the RCM?",
  allow_retry = FALSE,
  answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Ok")
  )
```

### Exercise 4

```{r ce-4}
quiz(question("Choose the response variable.",
         answer("$t$"),
         answer("$u$"),
         answer("$Y$", correct = TRUE),
         answer("$c$"), 
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
     )
```

<!-- DK: This question is interesting, but not clear enough for this draft. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 5 -->

<!-- ```{r ce-5} -->
<!-- quiz( -->
<!--   question_text("Why do we need more than one response variable if we are trying to understand a causal effect? How are the two response variables different? (Two short sentences/phrases)", -->
<!--   allow_retry = FALSE, -->
<!--   answer(NULL, correct = TRUE), -->
<!--   incorrect = "Ok", -->
<!--   trim = FALSE) -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Potential outcomes
###

Consider both what did happen --- the factual --- and what might have happened --- the counterfactual.

### Exercise 1

```{r po-1}
quiz(question_text("In two sentences, what makes a Preceptor Table ideal, and why is this generally impossible to observe? You should use the phrase 'potential outcomes' in your answer.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok")
)
```

### Exercise 2

```{r po-2}
quiz(
  question("If we did not have an ideal Preceptor Table, could we directly calculate the causal effect for an individual like Yao?",
  answer("No", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Yes"),
  allow_retry = FALSE)
)
```



## Estimands
###

<!-- DK: This section is a real mess. Please fix it. -->

```{r question-estimands}
quiz(

question_text("In one sentence, define what an estimand is, and give an example.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"),

question_checkbox(
  "Which of the following are examples of estimands?",
  answer("average treatment effect", correct = TRUE),
  answer("percent change", correct = TRUE),
  answer("44%", correct = FALSE),
  answer("most positive causal effect", correct = TRUE),
  answer("+2", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = FALSE, 
  random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```

Use the following ideal Preceptor Table to answer some questions about potential estimands we might be interested in.

```{r question-estimands2-setup, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("11", "13", "10", "8", "6"),
       ycontrol = c("9", "10", "11", "10", "4"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$"))  %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)  %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Outcomes$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol))  %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Estimands$$", vars(ydiff))
```

<!-- DK: Need to standardize on whether or not we need the + in the answer is positive. Here we require it, elsewhere we do not. -->

```{r question-estimands2-quiz}
# quiz(
# question_text("What is the casual effect of the treatment on Yao (answer as +/-X)?",
#     answer("+2", correct = TRUE),
#     allow_retry = TRUE
#   ),
# 
# question("For how many of the five is the casual effect of the treatment positive?",
#     answer("1"),
#     answer("2"),
#     answer("3", correct = TRUE),
#     answer("4"),
#     answer("5"),
#     allow_retry = F
#   ),

```

## Preceptor Table structure
###

```{r question-preceptortable2}
quiz(
  
question_text("In one sentence, describe the difference between an actual and ideal Preceptor Table.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),

question_checkbox(
  "Which of the following are types of columns you might expect to see in a Preceptor Table",
  answer("ID", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Outcomes", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Covariates", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Estimands", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Predictions", correct = FALSE),
  answer("Observations", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = FALSE, 
  random_answer_order = T
),

question_text("What is the correct order of columns in a Preceptor Table following the ID column? (list in order from left to right starting with the ID column).",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

## Simple models
###

```{r question-simplemodels}
quiz(
question_text("In a very short sentence or phrase, why do we need a model?",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

## A single value for tau
###

In these exercises, we will assume that the causal effect, $\tau$ (pronunced tau), is the same for everyone.

### Exercise 1

```{r question-singletau}
quiz(
question_text("In one sentence, what is the big assumption we are making about casual effect by only using one value for tau?",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

### Exercise 2

<!-- DK: Why make the math hard? This should be easy to do in your head.  -->

Use the following actual Preceptor Table to answer questions about a single value for tau.

```{r question-singletau-setup, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Outcomes$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Estimands$$", vars(ydiff)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare-actual, echo=FALSE}
actualPT <- tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c(13, 11, NA, NA, 5),
       ycontrol = c(NA, NA, 10, 12, NA),
       ydiff = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
```

<!-- CB: Don't know if this is actually useful at all but maybe people would like it to practice -->

```{r question-single-tau-console, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-actual"}

# A tibble with the values used in the above Preceptor Table is loaded as
# actualPT. You can use this console for your convenience, but nothing you do in
# the console will be graded.

glimpse(actualPT)
```

```{r question-singletau2}
quiz(
  question_text("Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate Yao's $Y_c(u)$. (Do not use actual numbers, use tau in your explanation).",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),
  question_text("Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate Tahmids's $Y_t(u)$. (Do not use actual numbers, use tau in your explanation).",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),
  question_text("Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate a single value for tau.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

The same Preceptor Table and console to minimize scrolling.

```{r question-singletau3-setup, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),

       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),

  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),

       ycontrol = c(NA, NA, 10, 12, NA),
       ydiff = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
```

``` {r question-single-tau3}
quiz(
  question_text("What is your estimate for a single value for tau? (answer as +/-X.XX)",
    answer("-1.33", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question_text("What is your estimate for $Y_c(u)$ for Emma? (answer as XX.XX)",
    answer("12.33", correct = TRUE),

  ),
question_text("What is your estimate for $Y_t(u)$ for Cassidy? (answer as X.XX)",
  answer("8.67", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Two values for tau
###

As we do in the book, let's now assume that the causal effect varies across sexes. We will use two estimates for tau. (Cassidy and Emma are female, Tahmid, Diego, and Yao are male).

### Exercise 1

```{r question-twotau-setup, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Outcomes$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Estimands$$", vars(ydiff)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare-two-tau, echo=FALSE}
actualPT <- tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c(13, 11, NA, NA, 5),
       ycontrol = c(NA, NA, 10, 12, NA),
       ydiff = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
```

```{r question-two-tau-console, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-two-tau"}
# A tibble with the values used in the above Preceptor Table is loaded as
# actualPT. You can use this console for your convenience, but nothing you do in
# the console will be graded.

actualPT
```

```{r question-two-tau}
quiz(
  question_text("How would you calculate $\\tau_F$? Use only words and no numbers.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),
  question_text("What is $\\tau_M$? (Answer as +/-X)",
    answer("-3", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question_text("What is your new estimate for Diego's $Y_c(u)$? (Answer as X)",
    answer("8", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question_text("In a couple of sentences, explain how we have two different estimates for Emma depending on assumptions we make.",
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    trim = FALSE,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```


## Average treatment effect
###

We will no longer make any assumptions about $\tau$. Instead, we are interested in estimating the average treatment effect, both for the entire sample and for subsets of it.


### Exercise 1

```{r question-setup, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("11", "13", "?", "?", "6"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "11", "10", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)

```

```{r question-2-2}
quiz(
question("Estimate the ATE based on the data given to you in the above Preceptor Table.",
    answer("-0.5", correct = TRUE),
    answer("+1"),
    answer("-1.33"),
    answer("+2"),
    allow_retry = TRUE)
)
```

<div id="question-2-2-hint">
**Hint:**  Average of treated values minus the average of control values is the standard way of estimating the ATE.

<!-- DK: Shouldn't all of these be split into separate Exercises? That would mean putting each of them in their own R code chunk, which seems preferable. -->

<!-- DK: Make the math easy to do in your head! Integers only. -->

<!-- DK: Is there a way to ensure that the answers are correct by, for example, calculating them directly from the data which makes the table? -->

<!-- DK: Cut half of these as being too repetitive. -->

### Exercise 2

```{r question-2-3-a--quiz}
quiz(
question_text("Before assigning any number to our causal effect, let's work using a single causal effect for everyone called $\\tau$. What would be Yao's $Y_c(u)$. You can write tau for $\\tau$. Don't put spaces in your answer. Your answer should look like 13+tau or 10-tau.",

```

## Missing Data
###

Every problem in data science is ultimately a missing data problem. If the ideal Preceptor Table is available, we need only do some arithmetic. 


### Exercise 1

```{r question-3-1-quiz}

quiz(

question_text("In addition to not being able to observe counterfactal outcomes, what is another source of missing data in Preceptor Tables?",
    allow_retry = TRUE,

question_text("In order to apply the causal effect of a sample to the general population, our samaple must be ______ of the population.",
    allow_retry = TRUE,

    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),

question_text("Explain representativeness as a concept in sampling.",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),

  ),

# DK: Not sure I like this question. What is the answer?

question_text("Why might Infinite Preceptor Tables include additional treatment columns?",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),

# DK: How closely connected are these to the book?

question_text("When you begin working on a causal question, you begin with the idea of an Infinite Preceptor Table. What three assumptions do you make to narrow this idea down to a Preceptor Table which you can work with?",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)

```

## Uncertainty and Confounding
###


<!-- This must be updated to match the latest version of the book. Needs to focus less on parameter uncertainty and more on the perfect doctor idea -- you never know if you are assigning the treatments to a truly random selection of people  -->

### Exercise 1

```{r question-4-1-quiz}

## MB: This question is bad, but based directly in the chapter. Keep?
